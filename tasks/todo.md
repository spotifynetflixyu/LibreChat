# V8.2 Spec Upgrade

- [x] Read current v8.1 plan package, Supabase schema, and project glossary before writing v8.2.
- [x] Create `steel_librechat_plan_v8.2.md` in Traditional Chinese as an executable development spec.
- [x] Remove external database/enterprise connector planning and replace old import wording with ERP XLSX / Admin Import wording.
- [x] Add Admin ERP XLSX upload policy, seven fixed Workbook sheets, Quote Resolution Engine, eval harness, interfaces, API routes, schemas, and production checklist.
- [x] Verify required v8.2 terms are present and removed v8.1 planning terms are absent.
- [x] Rename `tasks/v8.1` to `tasks/v8.2` and update the phase plans to match `steel_librechat_plan_v8.2.md`.
- [x] Verify `tasks/v8.2` no longer contains stale v8.1-only import, workbook, PDF, or connector assumptions.
- [x] Apply user correction: remove Admin PDF parser/transformation planning and restrict ongoing Admin data uploads to ERP XLSX only.

## Review

- User supplied the v8.2 handoff as the approved design baseline. The task is to consolidate it into one implementation-ready spec file, not to implement runtime code yet.
- Created `steel_librechat_plan_v8.2.md` with 30 core sections plus API route, Mongo schema, Supabase schema, Admin preview, UX, and production checklist drafts.
- Verification checked required v8.2 anchors, TypeScript interface draft names, fixed seven-sheet names, Admin ERP XLSX upload policy, ExcelJS, Supabase PostgreSQL, and removed old connector/import planning terms.
- Renamed the phase-plan package from `tasks/v8.1` to `tasks/v8.2` and rewrote README, checkpoints, and phases 0-5 around v8.2.
- Phase plans now include Admin ERP XLSX upload policy, ERP XLSX Admin Import, fixed seven-sheet Workbook, Quote Resolution Engine, normalization, price search/ranking, stock allocation, deterministic calculators, ExcelJS export, Admin preview, table UI maintenance, handbook-informed schema boundary, and eval harness gates.

# V8.2 Dev Planning Package

- [x] Read `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`, and `docs/plan_v8.1.md`.
- [x] Inventory current Steel implementation state before planning new work.
- [x] Create phase-based dev plans under `tasks/v8.2/`.
- [x] Add checkpoints, acceptance criteria, verification commands, and PM decision gates.
- [x] Verify the plan package covers all major v8.2 modules and current repo constraints.
- [x] Record planning review results.

## Review

- `docs/plan_v8.1.md` is an architecture and feature planning doc, not an implementation-ready task breakdown.
- Current implemented Steel code is still narrow: `packages/api/src/steel/postgres.ts`, its unit test, the initial Supabase schema/migration, and local-dev docs.
- Existing domain glossary already defines `Canonical Product`, `Product Alias`, `Spec Candidate`, `Preference Rule`, and `Clarification`; the dev plan must preserve those terms.
- This pass should not import or process `docs/reference/doc` source files during planning; later correction scoped the steel handbook DOCX as a schema/data-model reference.
- The requested output location is now `tasks/v8.2/`, so this planning package intentionally uses that path instead of the generic `docs/plans/` convention.
- Created the v8.2 plan package: `README.md`, phase 0-5 plan files, and `checkpoints.md`.
- User corrected guest mode: quote conversation/workbook/export access must be controlled by an environment flag. Enabled means no login or permission required; disabled means login plus admin-approved Steel permission required.
- Grill-with-docs resolved the guest mode default: `STEEL_GUEST_MODE` defaults to `false` and fails closed unless explicitly set to `true`.
- Phase 0 high-risk decisions are now recorded through the export library decision.
- Grill-with-docs resolved the OpenAI state contract: Responses API calls use `conversation` only; `previous_response_id` is mutually exclusive with `conversation` and is stored only for audit/fallback.
- User corrected quote traceability: workbook lines must persist the related formula, database default unit price, quoted unit price, line total, and explicit unit-price/total-price adjustments as permanent workbook data.
- Grill-with-docs resolved workbook price stability: latest database unit price is only the default for new pricing or explicit recalculation; existing workbook prices, quantities, and totals must not change unless the user asks to change that line.
- v8.2 Admin data updates use admin-uploaded ERP export XLSX files; rows missing confirmed ERP lookup keys go to `needs_review`.
- Grill-with-docs resolved retrieval strategy: Steel uses its own PostgreSQL + pgvector retrieval module so required project/source/version/chunk/category/guest filters are enforced server-side.
- Grill-with-docs resolved customer Excel mask: allow only customer quote fields using `quoted_unit_price` and `line_total` for visible prices, and hide `customer_tier` plus internal/debug fields.
- Grill-with-docs resolved async boundary: first prove a real OpenAI chat can create a customer-visible workbook; keep MVP small flows synchronous with payload/timeout limits and defer BullMQ to Phase 5 unless measured scale forces it earlier.
- Grill-with-docs resolved source data readiness: ongoing real data updates flow through ERP XLSX upload or Admin table UI review, then backend API commit; steel handbook DOCX first informs schema/data-model design.
- Current dependency check found `openai@5.8.2` only in the legacy `api` package, and `xlsx@0.20.3` but no `exceljs`; Phase 4 must add ExcelJS deliberately to the backend package that owns customer-facing export rendering.
- Grill-with-docs resolved export rendering: use ExcelJS for customer-facing XLSX output, while keeping `xlsx` for admin import parsing and generated workbook read-back tests unless implementation proves consolidation is better.
- The plan covers all final v8.2 modules through phase ownership: conversation meta, projects, sources, instructions, handbook-informed schema boundary, Admin ERP XLSX source parsing, Admin table maintenance, Admin import, AI merge table, tool registry, OpenAI orchestrator, prompt builder, Quote Resolution Engine, normalization, pricing, stock allocation, calculators, workbook, Excel export, memory, retrieval, evals, audit, repositories, permissions, and async jobs.
- User clarified Phase 0 should not require a live OpenAI smoke test; live provider verification belongs to Phase 3's quote workbook vertical slice.
- User clarified Admin data import flow: export XLSX from ERP, upload through parser, compare with old data, admin confirm, then update the database.
- User clarified DOCX scope again: code agent should first use the steel handbook DOCX to design schema/data model; chat UX development is priority; real handbook data SQL/import implementation comes later.
- User clarified current reference data state: files in `docs/reference/doc` are not database-ready; AI/code agents may reference them for schema and API mock data while prioritizing chat UX, with real data handling deferred.
- User clarified API mock data placement: keep mock data in one shared folder, not separate frontend/backend folders.
- User accepted the API mock export boundary: import mock fixtures through `packages/data-provider/src/steel/mock/`, not the production Steel data-provider barrel.
- User accepted the Phase 3 UI boundary: build an independent Steel workspace first, and use one shared desktop/mobile Steel UX framework rather than separate mobile workflow.
- User clarified mobile workbook UX: open workbook as a full-view modal with top-right close, allow one selected workbook cell to populate a composer marker, submit one structured ref plus user text to AI, and sync returned workbook patches back to the UI.
- User clarified workbook edit targeting: Phase 3 supports one selected cell at a time; workbook data can still be modified across multi-round chat, or by natural-language requests that describe multiple explicit changes for AI to translate into validated patch ops.
- User rejected per-patch preview/confirmation because it slows chat UX; latest accepted workbook updates should be marked by background color on the changed fields.
- User chose latest-update highlight lifetime: keep highlighted changed fields until the next accepted workbook patch replaces them.
- User clarified failed/rejected AI patches should not highlight workbook fields; show the reason in chat and leave workbook/highlight state unchanged.
- User rejected explicit Undo UI; revert/change requests should go through chat and create normal validated workbook patches.
- User accepted short chat summaries for successful AI workbook patches; list changed fields briefly, but do not show a full diff table in chat.
- User accepted contract ownership: public workbook DTOs live in `packages/data-provider/src/steel/workbooks.ts`, backend canonical Zod validation lives in `packages/api/src/steel/workbook/schema.ts`, and frontend/mock data consume shared DTOs without owning workbook validation schema.
- User clarified Chinese source data handling: `docs/reference/doc` is Chinese, so Phase 2 needs a schema mapping from Chinese source labels/headers/terms to English canonical schema keys; programmatic DTO/API/tool/repository/DB query contracts should use English keys while Chinese remains as display/source/alias data.
- User corrected reference-data framing: `docs/reference/doc` can be used to design the real Steel schema/data model, not only mock fixtures; real data SQL/import is deferred to a later code-agent data task that starts from correct data.
- User resolved source-schema mapping decisions: create `tasks/v8.2/source-schema-mapping.md`; do not add typo approval/review-status fields because later code-agent data work should already use correct data; teach AI API the mapping so it can resolve correct schema keys; keep mock data schema-realistic; and design a code-owned source-schema mapping module alongside real schema design.

## Review

- `docs/plan_v8.1.md` requires MongoDB for LibreChat/application state and PostgreSQL `steel` schema for structured steel business data.
- `.env` already has a non-empty `STEEL_POSTGRES_URL`.
- The development database target is Supabase Postgres via `STEEL_POSTGRES_URL`; Docker is intentionally out of scope for this setup.
- The MongoDB target is the configured cloud MongoDB via `MONGO_URI`; Docker MongoDB is intentionally out of scope.
- `psql` CLI is not currently available on PATH.
- Supabase SQL access is verified by the user; `vector` extension exists at version `0.8.0` in the `public` schema.
- Supabase CLI is not currently available on PATH, so the initial migration filename is created directly rather than via `supabase migration new`.
- Added `supabase/schema.sql` and `supabase/migration/202605230001_initial_steel_schema.sql`; both currently contain the same initial Steel schema.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` so code agents must update the full schema snapshot and add a one-change migration together.
- Supabase SQL Editor reported the initial migration succeeded with no returned rows.
- `source_embeddings.embedding` was verified as PostgreSQL `vector`.
- `docs/reference/doc` contains company reference inputs: `龍頂鋼鐵手冊__文字版.docx` is now scoped as a schema/data-model reference; `公式編號.xlsx`, `客戶資料.xlsx`, `產品價格.xlsx`, and `系統訂單.xlsx` remain reference/import fixtures unless promoted through ERP XLSX import.
- Runtime AI should query normalized database/tool results, not directly inspect XLSX/DOCX reference files for prices or specs.
- The `steel` schema table list contains all 21 expected base tables.
- Trigger wiring is present: `price_items` has `record_price_history`, and every table with an `updated_at` column has `set_updated_at`.
- Rollback smoke test proved `price_items.unit_price` updates write `steel.price_history` with `old_unit_price`, `new_unit_price`, and `last_import_log_id`.
- Do not process or import `docs/reference/doc` files as real data in the chat UX priority path; steel handbook DOCX may inform schema/data-model design, while real data SQL/import comes later.
- Current dependency check: `packages/api` has `zod` and `ioredis`; no Postgres client dependency is present yet. `openai` is currently only declared in the legacy `api` package.
- Ambiguous customer terms such as `常用的` should resolve through admin-taught preference rules/memory, not hard-coded product-table defaults such as `is_default`.
- For incomplete price questions with multiple matching specs, AI should ask for the missing spec detail and may show all candidate prices, e.g. t8 and t12, in NTD.
- User approved `pg` for the Steel backend Postgres access layer.
- Added `pg` runtime dependency for `api`, `pg` peer dependency for `packages/api`, and `@types/pg` for `packages/api`.
- Added `packages/api/src/steel/postgres.ts` with `STEEL_POSTGRES_URL` config, conservative pool defaults, and a read-only readiness query.
- The focused Steel Postgres unit test passes, and `npm run build:api` completes without TypeScript warnings.
- Read-only live smoke is blocked because the current `STEEL_POSTGRES_URL` uses a direct Supabase host that does not resolve from this environment; use Supavisor session pooler for IPv4-compatible local development.
- To reduce future upstream merge conflicts, Steel code should stay in additive project-specific paths; premature root exports/core entrypoint edits should be avoided until runtime integration needs them.
- After switching `STEEL_POSTGRES_URL` to the Supavisor session pooler, DNS resolves to IPv4 and the read-only helper smoke query returns `steelSchemaExists=true`, `steelTableCount=21`, and `vectorExtensionVersion=0.8.0`.
- Additional SSL introspection returned `ssl=false`; treat Supabase pooler TLS/CA verification as a separate explicit preflight decision before production deployment.
- Testing `?sslmode=require` alone with the current Node `pg` stack fails with `self-signed certificate in certificate chain` because current `pg-connection-string` treats `require` like `verify-full`.
- Testing `?sslmode=require&uselibpqcompat=true` succeeds for the read-only Supabase smoke query, but production should still prefer explicit CA-backed `verify-full` once the Supabase CA certificate is configured.
- `.env` now uses the Supavisor session pooler with `sslmode=require&uselibpqcompat=true`, and the Steel Postgres helper smoke query passes.

# V8.2 Phase 0 Lock Pass

- [x] Collect all remaining Phase 0 questions in one pass.
- [x] Record user approval for the Phase 0 lock answers.
- [x] Update `tasks/v8.2/phase-0-decisions.md` with the final lock review.
- [x] Run Checkpoint 0 focused verification.

## Review

- User approved all final Phase 0 lock answers.
- Phase 0 is locked with D0.1-D0.14 as the decision baseline.
- Phase 1 implementation should stay narrow around contracts, auth/permission gates, route shells, audit, and foundational schema seams.
- Phase 2 should extend `tasks/v8.2/source-schema-mapping.md`, design `packages/api/src/steel/schema/mapping.ts`, and derive the minimal Supabase schema delta from handbook/mapping work.
- Phase 3 mock data may proceed with locked canonical keys without waiting for full mapping coverage.
- Checkpoint 0 verification passed for fixed workbook sheets, ERP XLSX/DOCX boundary, ExcelJS/Quote Resolution/Eval Harness anchors, and source-schema mapping anchors.
- `docs/local-dev.md` documents the local Steel `STEEL_POSTGRES_URL` pooler format.

## Review

- `.env` contains `MONGO_URI` and `STEEL_POSTGRES_URL` keys; values were not printed.
- Minimal build path for `npm run frontend:dev`: `npm run build:data-provider && npm run build:client-package`.
- `npm run build:data-provider` completed successfully.
- `npm run build:client-package` completed successfully and recreated `packages/client/dist`.
- `npm run frontend:dev` started Vite successfully on `http://localhost:3090/`; a direct HTTP probe returned `200 OK`.
- The final npm lifecycle error came from intentionally stopping the smoke-test process after startup verification.
- Later `/api/config` proxy error root cause: backend was not listening on port 3080.
- Direct backend startup showed MongoDB connected, then backend exited because `/Users/neven/Documents/projects/LibreChat/client/dist/index.html` was missing.
- `npm run build:client` completed successfully and created `client/dist/index.html`.
- After `npm run backend:dev`, `http://localhost:3080/health`, `http://localhost:3080/readyz`, and `http://localhost:3080/api/config` returned `200`.
- With `npm run frontend:dev` running too, `http://localhost:3090/api/config` returned `200` through the Vite proxy.
- Smoke-test backend/frontend processes launched by Codex were stopped after verification.
- Added `docs/local-dev.md` with the verified command sequence and `/api/config` proxy troubleshooting note.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` to point to `docs/local-dev.md`.
- Created a minimal root `librechat.yaml` with `version: 1.3.11`.
- Verified `npm run backend:dev` starts after adding `librechat.yaml`; `http://localhost:3080/health` and `http://localhost:3080/api/config` returned `200`.
- Documented local `librechat.yaml` and MeiliSearch log handling in `docs/local-dev.md`.
- Disabled local MeiliSearch by setting `SEARCH=false`, clearing `MEILI_HOST` and `MEILI_MASTER_KEY`, and setting `MEILI_NO_SYNC=true` in `.env`.
- Verified backend startup after disabling MeiliSearch: `http://localhost:3080/api/config` returned `200`, and captured startup logs had no `mongoMeili`, `indexSync`, or `fetch failed` lines.
